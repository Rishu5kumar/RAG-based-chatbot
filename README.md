# RAG-based-chatbot

This project is a RAG-based-chatbot that answers questions based on a text file the user uploads. It works by:

1. **Reading and breaking the document into smaller pieces** so we can efficiently search for relevant information.
2. **Training a Word2Vec model** to understand the meaning and relationships of words in the document.
3. **Retrieving relevant information** when a user asks a question by comparing the words in the question to the words in the document.
4. **Using Google Gemini AI** to generate an answer using the retrieved information.
5. **Displaying everything on a simple website** using Streamlit.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
### Setting Up the Required Tools
Before starting, we need to import libraries that help us perform different tasks. Here’s what each library does:

- Streamlit → Helps us build a simple web interface where users can upload files and ask questions.
- Google Generative AI (Gemini) → Used to generate answers based on relevant information from the document.
- dotenv → Used to securely store and load the API key for Gemini AI.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) → Helps in processing text, breaking sentences into words, and removing unnecessary words.
- Gensim (Word2Vec model) → Learns the relationships between words, helping to find similar words in the text.
- NumPy → Used for performing mathematical operations like calculating word similarity.
- LangChain → Splits long documents into smaller, more manageable parts for easy searching.

### Fixing Missing Downloads (NLTK Tokenizer)
- Why is this needed?
When working with text, we need a way to break sentences into words (called "tokenization"). NLTK provides a tool for this, but it may not be installed by default. So, we download it manually to make sure everything works smoothly.

### Loading API Key for Gemini AI

- Google Gemini AI is a cloud-based service, meaning it doesn’t run directly on our computer. Instead, we send a request to Google’s servers, and they return a response.
- To use Gemini AI, we need an API key (like a password) that allows us to communicate with it.
- We store the API key securely in a .env file instead of writing it directly in our code. This prevents others from misusing it.

### Splitting the Document into Smaller Parts

- If a document is very large, searching for relevant information becomes slow and inefficient.
- Instead of working with the whole document at once, we break it into smaller pieces (called "chunks").
- Each chunk is about 500 characters long, with a 50-character overlap between chunks.
- The overlap helps ensure that important sentences that span two chunks are not lost.

Example:

Let’s say we have this text:
"AI is the future of technology. Machine learning is a key part of AI."
After splitting, the first chunk might be:
"AI is the future of technology."
And the second chunk might be:
"technology. Machine learning is a key part of AI."
This way, "technology" is in both chunks, ensuring smooth transitions.

### Training the Word2Vec Model

- Word2Vec is a machine learning model that helps computers understand relationships between words.
- Instead of treating words as just letters, it converts them into mathematical vectors (lists of numbers) so they can be compared.
- Words that appear in similar contexts will have similar vector representations.

Example:

- If a document contains the sentence: "AI is smart", Word2Vec learns that "AI" and "smart" are related.
- If another sentence says, "AI is intelligent", Word2Vec understands that "intelligent" is similar to "smart".
- If a user asks, "Is AI intelligent?", Word2Vec recognizes that "intelligent" is similar to "smart" and finds relevant text.

How does training work?

- The document is broken into sentences.
- Each sentence is split into words.
- Word2Vec learns patterns and relationships between words by looking at how often they appear together.

### Retrieving Relevant Context (Finding the Best Answer Source)

- When a user asks a question, we don’t want to search the whole document.
- Instead, we find the most relevant chunks of text and use them to answer the question.

How does it work?

- The question is broken into words.
- We compare each word to the words in every text chunk.
- Using Word2Vec, we check which chunk has the most similar words.
- The top 2 most relevant chunks are selected and passed to Gemini AI.

Example:

User asks: "What is AI?"
The document has chunks like:
Chunk 1: "AI is the future of technology."
Chunk 2: "Machine learning is a part of AI."
The chatbot selects Chunk 1 and Chunk 2 because they contain the most relevant words.

### Generating the Final Answer with Google Gemini AI
Why do we use Gemini AI?

- Even though Word2Vec helps us find relevant text, it cannot generate human-like answers.
- Instead, we send the relevant text to Gemini AI, which reads it and creates a well-structured response.

How does it work?

- We combine the retrieved text chunks into a single prompt.
- We send this prompt to Google Gemini AI.
- Gemini analyzes the text and generates a natural answer.

Example:

- If the user asks: "What is AI?", and the document says "AI is the future of technology.", Gemini might generate:
"AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which is a field of technology focused on building smart systems."

### Streamlit Web App (Making Everything User-Friendly)
What is Streamlit?

- Streamlit is a Python library that helps us create a simple web app without needing advanced web development skills.
- Instead of running the chatbot in a terminal, we create a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can:
  - Upload a document
  - Type a question
  - See the AI-generated answer

How does the app work?

- A user uploads a text file.
- The file is processed and stored.
- The Word2Vec model is trained on the document.
- The user asks a question in a text box.
- The chatbot retrieves relevant text and uses Gemini AI to generate a response.
- The answer is displayed on the webpage.

Example:

1. User uploads a file about AI.
2. They type "What is deep learning?"
3. The chatbot searches for relevant information.
4. Gemini AI generates: "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to process data."
5. The answer appears on the screen.

# Sample Example
We will go through each step, assuming we have a text document uploaded.

## User Uploads a Document
Let's assume the user uploads a text file with the following content:

```
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating smart systems.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data.
Deep Learning, a part of ML, uses neural networks to make decisions.
AI is widely used in healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.
```

## Document is Split into Chunks
Since the document is short, it might be split into two chunks like this:

Chunk 1:
```
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating smart systems. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data.
```

Chunk 2:
```
Deep Learning, a part of ML, uses neural networks to make decisions. AI is widely used in healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.
```

## Word2Vec Model is Trained

- The Word2Vec model reads the document and learns word relationships.
- It now understands that "AI" is related to "Machine Learning", and "Deep Learning" is related to "Neural Networks".

## User Asks a Question

The user enters:
"What is deep learning?"

## Finding Relevant Text

- The chatbot tokenizes the question → ["What", "is", "deep", "learning", "?"]
- It compares these words to words in each chunk using Word2Vec.
- Chunk 2 is most relevant because it contains "Deep Learning" and "Neural Networks".

Retrieved Context:

"Deep Learning, a part of ML, uses neural networks to make decisions."

## Generating Answer Using Gemini AI

- The chatbot sends this retrieved context to Google Gemini AI with the following prompt:

Prompt Sent to Gemini AI:

*You are a helpful AI assistant. Answer the following question based on the provided information.
Relevant Context: Deep Learning, a part of ML, uses neural networks to make decisions.
User's Question: What is deep learning?
Answer:*

- Gemini AI generates this response:

"Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to process complex data patterns and make intelligent decisions."

## Answer is Displayed
The chatbot shows:

AI Response:

"Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to process complex data patterns and make intelligent decisions."

## Final Result
- User uploaded a document.
- The document was split into smaller chunks.
- A Word2Vec model was trained to learn word relationships.
- The user asked a question.
- The chatbot found the most relevant text.
- Gemini AI generated a clear answer.
- The answer was displayed on the Streamlit web app.
